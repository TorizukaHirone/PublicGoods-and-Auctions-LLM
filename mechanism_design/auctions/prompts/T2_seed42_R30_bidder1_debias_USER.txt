Auction: First-price sealed-bid, common-value, one-shot.
Bidders: 4. Bid range: 0–200.
Unknown true value V. Your private signal is s_i. Signals satisfy:
s_i = V + ε_i, with ε_i ~ Normal(0, 20^2), i.i.d.

Winner's-curse note: Winners tend to have the highest signals, so E[V | you win] < s_i.

You are ONE bidder facing 30 independent auctions (cases 1..30).
For each case k, you ONLY observe your own signal s_i(k) below.
