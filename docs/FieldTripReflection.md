# Field Trip Reflection — Comparative and Liberal Arts Reflections
## Part A: Computational Game Theory in Global Context
- **Promise:** Cloud platforms (AWS, Tencent Cloud) enable scalable equilibrium simulations for markets, auctions, and trading.
- **Peril:** Risks include opacity, concentration of power, and unequal access.
- **Comparison:** U.S. ecosystems emphasize modular innovation and ties with startups, while China stresses integrated platforms and regulatory alignment.
- **Ethical Lens:** Both models raise concerns connected to SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG 16 (Strong Institutions).


Additional insights:
- In the U.S., decentralization fosters innovation but can exacerbate inequality in access to computation.
- In China, strong government alignment ensures rapid scaling but may reduce transparency and pluralism.
- A balanced approach should harness scalability while embedding accountability and inclusiveness.


## Part B: Liberal Arts & Global Leadership
- Liberal arts provide **critical reflection, interdisciplinarity, and ethical reasoning**.
- Encourages questioning not just *how* to compute equilibria, but *why they matter* for society.
- Duke Kunshan’s liberal arts model integrates cross-cultural dialogue and global perspectives, preparing responsible leaders to align computational economics with fairness, transparency, and collective welfare.


Further reflections:
- Liberal arts education helps bridge technical solutions and human values, ensuring algorithms and models respect diversity and justice.
- Cultivating leadership through this model means training students to see beyond efficiency into legitimacy and equity.
- This aligns directly with preparing for the AI age, where decision-making systems must be interpretable and ethically grounded.

## Key Takeaways
- Computational game theory is both promising and perilous; governance determines its societal impact.
- Liberal arts values are essential to guide technical innovation toward just and sustainable outcomes.
- Future leaders must integrate theory, computation, and ethics to address global challenges responsibly.
