## üóÇÔ∏è Usage Notes
- **File naming** is consistent with report sections; update if you regenerate plots.
- **README cross-links**: Root `README.md` references selected figures directly from these subfolders.
- **FAIR principles**: Figures are derived from scripts in `computational_scientist/`, `mechanism_design/auctions/scripts/`, and `mechanism_design/voting/scripts/`; reproduction steps are in each subfolder README.
